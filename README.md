# Xeus-Lite demo

[![lite-badge](https://jupyterlite.rtfd.io/en/latest/_static/badge.svg)](https://jupyterlite.github.io/xeus-lite-demo/notebooks/?path=demo.ipynb)

This GitHub template allows you to create deployments of JupyterLite with a custom set of conda packages.

## ðŸ’¡ How to make your own deployment

Creating a new deployment can be done in three easy steps:

**Step 1: Apply the GitHub template**

1. Click the **"Use this template"** button in the upper right corner of the GitHub repository.
2. Choose a name for your project and select the GitHub organization where you want to create it.
3. Then hit **"Create repository from template"** to finalize the setup.

**Step 2: Enable building the GitHub pages from GitHub actions.**

1. Once your repository is created, enable GitHub Pages by configuring GitHub Actions. This will build and deploy your site automatically.
2. Your deployment will be accessible at the following URL: https://{USERNAME}.github.io/{DEMO_REPO_NAME}.

**Step 3: Customize your conda environment**

1. Update your ``environment.yml`` file to include the required packages.
2. This ensures that your environment has all the necessary dependencies.

## ðŸ“¦ How to install kernels and packages

You can install specific kernels and extra packages by adding them to the ``environment.yml`` file.

See https://jupyterlite-xeus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environment.html for more documentation.

### Example 1: JupyterLite with NumPy and Matplotlib

To create a JupyterLite deployment with NumPy and Matplotlib pre-installed, edit the ``environment.yml`` file as follows:

```yml
name: xeus-kernel
channels:
  - https://repo.prefix.dev/emscripten-forge-dev
  - https://repo.prefix.dev/conda-forge
dependencies:
  - xeus-python
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
```

### Example 2: JupyterLite with R and coursekata

To use the R kernel and the coursekata package, edit the environment.yml file as follows:

```yml
name: xeus-kernel
channels:
  - https://repo.prefix.dev/emscripten-forge-dev
  - https://repo.prefix.dev/conda-forge
dependencies:
  - xeus-r
  - r-coursekata
```

### Example 3: JupyterLite with C++

To use the C++ kernel, edit the environment.yml file as follows:

```yml
name: xeus-kernel
channels:
  - https://repo.prefix.dev/emscripten-forge-dev
  - https://repo.prefix.dev/conda-forge
dependencies:
  - xeus-cpp
```
